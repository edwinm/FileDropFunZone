# **App Name**: FileDrop Explorer

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop: Implement a drag-and-drop area for file uploads.
- File List Display: Display a list of uploaded files with their names and sizes.
- Optical Character Recognition: Use an LLM to perform OCR on uploaded image files and add the text to a separate box as the file is added to the display. The LLM is a tool that will only be called when image files are detected in the upload.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft sky blue (#87CEEB) to convey a sense of calm and clarity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F8FF), almost white, for a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FF7F50) for interactive elements like buttons and file highlights.
- Use a playful and slightly rounded sans-serif font for all text elements.
- Use playful and recognizable icons for file types and actions.
- Keep a clean and intuitive layout, with the drag-and-drop area prominently displayed above the file list.
- Subtle animations for file uploads and list updates.
